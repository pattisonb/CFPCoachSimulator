"""Coach Career recruiting (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-coach-career-design.md, sections
2-5): a generated class of high school seniors, every FBS school's pull on each of them, and
(later sections of this file) the actions, the weekly step, signing and scouting.

The recruiting state lives in `state["recruiting"]` (a Coach Career season only):
    year, prospects {pid: prospect}, lists {pid: {slug: action points}}, status {pid: {committed,
    signed, fcs}}, offers {slug: [pid]}, visits {pid: {slug: week}}, contacts {pid: {slug:
    {hc_week}}}, hours {slug: hours left}, nil {slug: {budget, held {pid: points}}},
    revealed {slug: {pid: [topic]}}, board [pid], log [event]
A prospect's interest in a school = his priorities' weights on the school's pulls (each 0-1)
plus the points that school's actions have earned with him.

Values marked *tune* are set by tools/check_recruiting.py against the real classes.
